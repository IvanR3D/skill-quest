**Skill Quest** is an interactive, gamified web application that helps you visualize and track your learning progress through skill trees. Originally designed to work with [MakerSkillTree](https://github.com/sjpiper145/MakerSkillTree) SVG files, it transforms your learning journey into an engaging RPG-like experience with levels, achievements, and progress tracking.

## 🎯 What is This Project?

Skill Quest takes the concept of skill trees — visual learning paths — and adds gamification elements to make learning more engaging and rewarding. Think of it as a "RPG for real-life skills" where you:

- **Visualize** your learning path as interactive skill trees
- **Track progress** with XP, levels, and achievements
- **Stay motivated** with streaks, badges, and activity tracking
- **Manage** multiple skill trees across various categories

### 🔗 Connection to MakerSkillTree
This tool is specifically designed to work with SVG files generated by the [MakerSkillTree Generator](https://schme16.github.io/MakerSkillTree-Generator/), creating a seamless workflow from skill tree creation to progress tracking.

## 📊 Current Project Status

### ✅ **What Works Today**
- **Local Progress Tracking**: Full-featured offline-first application using LocalStorage
- **Skill Tree Management**: Import, organize, and categorize SVG skill trees
- **Gamification System**: 
  - XP & Level progression

- **Reward Marketplace**: Exchange XP for learning resources

#### 🤝 Social & Collaborative Features
- **Skill Completion Sharing**: Post when you complete skills with resources used
- **Learning Resource Database**: Crowd-sourced links, tutorials, and materials
- **Study Groups**: Create or join groups for specific skill trees
- **Mentor Matching**: Connect beginners with experienced learners

#### 📚 Resource Sharing System
- **Resource Attribution**: Tag resources (videos, articles, courses) to specific skills
- **Quality Voting**: Community-voted best resources for each skill
- **Learning Path Recommendations**: AI-suggested resources based on your progress
- **Progress Journals**: Document your learning journey for each skill

#### ☁️ Cloud & Sync Features
- **Cloud Backup**: Sync progress across devices
- **Public Profiles**: Share your skill tree progress publicly
- **API Access**: For developers to build integrations
- **Data Export**: To portfolio websites or LinkedIn
